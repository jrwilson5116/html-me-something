					<h1>Why Code?</h1>
				</header>
				
				<p>In the past I have been asked things like, &quot;why do you want to pursue coding?&quot;
				and &quot;won&apos;t you be bored stuck behind a desk all day long?&quot; Some have even gone as
				far as to suggest alternate routes in life that they consider better or less boring. 
				It can be difficult to explain the appeal to someone on the outside, yet to us, the 
				coders there is an intense level of enthusiasm for the craft.</p>
				<br>
				
				<p>Take a look at me from the outside while I am working on a tough practice problem 
				and it may just look like I am staring at a screen but I am not really there at all. 
				Yes, you read that right, I&apos;m not in the chair at all I am in the problem. When I&apos;m 
				programming I&apos;m able to reach a state that is not like anything else. It is a state of 
				complete focus where only the problem exists and time melts away. After I come out of 
				the other end there I feel immense satisfaction at what I accomplished in that time. 
				Nothing else pulls me into this state of complete focus like coding.  There are times
				when coding is frustrating and your code just doesnâ€™t want to work but the harder the
				problem is the bigger the dopamine hit when you finally defeat it.</p>
				<br>
				
				<p>Also I enjoy that programming takes both analytical skill and creativity. When you 
				are solving a problem, there are many roads that lead to Rome and if you look at ten other 
				coders solution, you are likely to see ten different solutions. There are infinitely many 
				solutions to any given problem. In this way code is like a snapshot of the coders analytical 
				and creative process at the time of writing it.</p>
				<br>
				
				<p>My idea of a boring and unrewarding job is one where you can learn 80%-90% of what you need 
				to know in the first few weeks. After that, everything is the same day in day out with few surprises.
				Programming is the exact opposite of that, it is a life of constant learning. There is an ocean of 
				information out there and the chances of exploring even a small area are slim.</p>
